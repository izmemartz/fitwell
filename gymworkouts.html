        <h2>What is PPL?</h2>
        <p>
            PPL stands for <strong>Push, Pull, Legs</strong>. It's a simple gym workout structure that divides exercises based on the movement patterns:
            <strong>Push</strong> day focuses on chest, shoulders, and triceps, <strong>Pull</strong> day targets back, biceps, and rear delts, 
            and <strong>Legs</strong> day works your quads, hamstrings, and glutes. This structure helps beginners balance training, recover properly, 
            and hit all major muscle groups effectively.
